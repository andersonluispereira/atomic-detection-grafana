# Auditd, Fluentbit, Loki, Grafana, Atomic
A fully open-source security stack for detecting Atomic Red Team simulations. Using Fluentbit, Loki, and Grafana to transform auditd logs into adversary insights.

| Component  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **auditd** | Linux kernel auditing framework used to capture security-relevant system events generated by Atomic Red Team executions. |
| **Fluentbit** | Lightweight telemetry pipeline that collects, parses, enriches, and labels auditd events before forwarding them to Loki. |
| **Loki** | Log aggregation and query engine optimized for high-cardinality security telemetry using LogQL. |
| **Grafana** | Visualization and alerting layer used to monitor Atomic Red Team activity and validate detection coverage in near real time. |

## Screenshots
The screenshot below highlights the Grafana Explore interface, which provides full visibility into auditd events ingested into Loki.
