| Component  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **auditd** | Linux kernel auditing framework used to capture security-relevant system events generated by Atomic Red Team executions. |
| **Fluentbit** | Lightweight telemetry pipeline that collects, parses, enriches, and labels auditd events before forwarding them to Loki. |
| **Loki** | Log aggregation and query engine optimized for high-cardinality security telemetry using LogQL. |
| **Grafana** | Visualization and alerting layer used to monitor Atomic Red Team activity and validate detection coverage in near real time. |
